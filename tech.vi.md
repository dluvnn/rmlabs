The field of Machine Learning (ML) can be understood as a science of learning systems. While the neurosciences and psychology aim to describe mechanisms of learning in humans and animals, Machine Learning aims to develop algorithms that demonstrate the ability to learn from data and improve with experience. Machine Learning has become a central subdiscipline of Artificial Intelligence and utilizes methods from statistical learning theory for efficient data analysis. In particular the great success of ML for data analysis has led to its application in many commercial and scientific applications, e.g., becoming a central tool for the dominant IT companies to exploit their data as well as for applications in bioinformatics and the neurosciences.
